      "contents": "\nWelcome to the Reproducible Finance with R blog.\nFinancial applications were an early driving force behind the adoption of the R language, but as data science becomes increasingly critical to banks, hedge funds, investment managers, data providers, exchanges, etc., R is becoming even more important to Finance. We are excited and inspired by what the future holds in the brave new world of data-driven financial institutions.\nWe hope that Reproducible Finance with R will attract other voices from around the R Community. If you have something to say on a finance related topic, news, commentary, or an example of using R in finance that you would like to share with the R Community, please email your ideas to jonathan.regenstein@rstudio.com.\nWe welcome comments from all readers and encourage discussion. However, comments will not be moderated. Please be courteous and civil.\n\n\n\n",
